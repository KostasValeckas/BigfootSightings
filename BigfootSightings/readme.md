This reposutory is a student project for the course 'Databases and Informations Systems' (DIS) at
DIKU, University of Copenhagen, 2024.

This repository uses code from the DIS project 'GreenGroceries' 
as a template:

## Initialization ‚úî

Clone / download repository files and run the following to install the required packages (preferably within a venv):

    pip install -r requirements.txt
-------------------------------------

### For Ubuntu:

We have experienced issues with installing psycopg2 on some Ubuntu distributions. If issues are encountered, try:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential
	sudo apt-get install python3-pip
	pip3 install psycopg2

, and then rerun the pip install command above (if the psycopg2 installation still throws an error 
while installing the requirment list, but it has been installed with the above pip3 command,
remove it temporarely from the requirment file before running the installation).

------------------------------------

Create a new database in pgAdmin (preferably named BigfootSightings) and add the following to your .env file 
(NOTE: this file will likely be hidden. Normally .env should be a private file containing user secrets, in this
case we have kept it inside the project files for easy
access for the TAs):

    SECRET_KEY=<secret_key>
    DB_USERNAME=postgres || <postgres_user_name>
    DB_PASSWORD=<postgres_user_password>
    DB_NAME=BigfootSightings || <postgres_db_name>
    
 Then, initiate the dabase by running while in the 'utils' directory:
 
    python3 init_db.py

Set the FLASK\_APP envirorment variable to __\_\_init\_\_.py__: 

macOS/Linux:

	export FLASK_APP=__init__.py

Windows:

	set FLASK_APP=__init__.py
 	
Finally, start serving the website with (run from the same directory as the __\_\_init\_\_.py__ file):

    flask run

## Folder setup üìÅ

The app is divided into multiple folders similar to the structure of the example project, with a few tweaks:

- __blueprints__: Contains all the separate blueprints of the app (submodules of the app the store different parts of
  the functionality)
- __dataset__: Contains the csv file used to import the produce data
- __static__: Contains static files like images, css and js files (in this case javascript was not needed in the
  frontend)
- __templates__: This is the template folder of the app that stores all html files that are displayed in the user
  browser
- __utils__: Contains the sql files and script that generate the postgresql database. Also contains a script that
  generates custom choices objects for flask forms used in SelectFields taken from the dataset.

At the root folder of the app (./BigfootSightings) six more scripts are present with the following roles:

- __\_\_init\_\_.py__: Initializes the flask app and creates a connection to the database (and a cursor object for
  future queries)
- __app.py__: Runs the app created by \_\_init__.py
- __filters.py__: Implements custom template filters for nicer formatting of data in the frontend
- __forms.py__: Implements forms used to save data from users (similar to the example project)
- __models.py__: Implements custom classes for each of the database tables to store data in a clean OOP manner (again,
  similar to the example project, but our models inherit the dict class for faster and more readable lookups)
- __queries.py__: Implements functions for each needed query to the database used inside the app (similar to the
  functional part of the models.py file within the example project)

## Routes üìå

Both implemented blueprints come with a __routes.py__ file that initialize a __Blueprint__ object and define _routes_
for the app.

- __Login__:
    - __/home__: Home page
    - __/about__: About page
    - __/style-guide__: Style guide (displays all html elements used, just for fun and css debugging)
    - __/login__: User login page (for simplicity in debugging, password hashing was omitted even though the example
      project made it pretty clear and easy to implement with bcrypt)
    - __/signup__: User signup (creation) page
    - __/logout__: Logs user out and sends back to login page

- __Sightings__:
    - __/add-sighting__: Page where users can add Bigfoot sightings
    - __/all-sightings__: Page where all registered Bigfoot sightings are displayed.
